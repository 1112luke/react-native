In just over two weeks, the community sent ~40 Pull Requests to complete this work for flow typed native modules. Aside from the people already mentioned above, we’d like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/michalchudziak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Chudziak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thymikee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Pierzchała</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wojteg1337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wojtek Szafraniec</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jeanregisser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean Regisser</a> and everyone else who sent one or more Pull Requests.</li><li><strong>Haste:</strong> Since 2015 React Native used the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/0629e3e2289ed54fac854472aec9a5f6c8318c98#diff-c42b758729cb89976b3a8fd51d1227fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“haste” module system</a> that allows importing modules just via a global id instead of a relative path which is convenient but not well supported by many tools. <a href="https://twitter.com/JI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Ide</a> proposed removing haste, similar to how React removed haste many years ago. He planned all the work through an <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">umbrella task</a> and he sent 18 Pull Requests to make it happen!

In just a six months repositories like <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetInfo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AsyncStorage</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI</a> received more than 800 Pull Requests combined. Besides better maintenance, these projects can also be independently released more often than React Native itself.</p><p>We have also taken the opportunity to remove obsolete polyfills and legacy components from React Native itself. Polyfills were necessary in the past to support language features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Set</code></a> in older versions of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Now that React Native ships with a new version, these polyfills were removed.</p><p>This work is still in progress and many more things still need to be split out or removed both on the native and JavaScript side but there are early signs that we managed to reverse the trend of increasing the surface area and app size: When looking at the JavaScript bundle for example, about a year ago in version 0.54 the React Native JavaScript bundle size was 530kb and grew to 607kb (+77kb) by version 0.57 in just 6 months. Now we are seeing a bundle size reduction of 28kb down to 579kb on master, a delta of more than 100kb!</p><p>As we conclude the first iteration of the Lean Core effort, we will make an effort to be more intentional about new APIs added to React Native and we will continuously evaluate ways to make React Native smaller and faster, as well as finding ways to empower the community to take ownership of various components.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="user-feedback"></a>User Feedback<a class="hash-link" href="#user-feedback" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Six months ago we asked the community “<a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do you dislike about React Native?</a>” which gave a good overview of problems people are facing. We <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied to the post a few months ago</a> and it&#x27;s time to summarize the progress that was made on top issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Upgrading:</strong> The React Native community rallied around with multiple improvements to the upgrading experience: <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autolinking</a>, a better upgrading command via <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rn-diff-purge</a>, an upgrade helper website (coming soon). We’ll also make sure to communicate breaking changes and exciting new features by publishing blog posts for each major release. Many of these improvements will make future upgrades beyond the 0.60 release significantly easier.</li><li><strong>Support / Uncertainty:</strong> Many people were frustrated with the lack of activity on Pull Requests and general uncertainty about Facebook&#x27;s investment in React Native. As we&#x27;ve shown above, we can confidently say that we are ready for many more Pull Requests and we are eagerly looking forward to your proposals and contributions!</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> React Native 0.59 shipped with a new and much faster version of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Separately, we have been working on making it easier to enable <a href="/docs/performance#ram-bundles-inline-requires">inline-requires</a> by default and we have more exciting updates for you in the next couple of months.</li><li><strong>Documentation:</strong> We recently started an effort to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul and rewrite all of React Native&#x27;s documentation</a>. If you are looking to contribute, we’d love to get your help!</li><li><strong>Warnings in Xcode:</strong> We <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got rid of all the existing warnings</a> and are making an effort not to introduce new warnings.</li><li><strong>Hot Reloading:</strong> The React team is building a <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1126948870137753605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new hot reloading system</a> that will soon be integrated into React Native.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately we weren’t able to improve everything just yet:</p><ul><li><strong>Debugging:</strong> We fixed many inconvenient bugs and issues people that we have been running into every day, but unfortunately we haven&#x27;t made as much progress on this as we would like. We recognize that debugging with React Native isn&#x27;t great and we&#x27;ll prioritize improving this in the future.</li><li><strong>Metro symlinks:</strong> Unfortunately we haven&#x27;t been able to implement a simple and straightforward solution for this yet. However, React Native users <a href="https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared various workarounds</a> that may work for you.</li></ul><p>Given the large amount of changes in the past six months, we&#x27;d like to ask you the same question again.

Our goals were to reduce outstanding pull requests, reduce the project&#x27;s surface area, identify leading user problems, and establish guidelines for community management.</p><p>In the past two months, we made more progress than we expected. Read on for more details:</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="pull-requests"></a>Pull Requests<a class="hash-link" href="#pull-requests" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In order to build a healthy community, we must respond quickly to code contributions. In past years, we de-prioritized reviewing community contributions and accumulated 280 pull requests (December 2018). In the first milestone, we reduced the number of open pull requests to ~65. Simultaneously, the average number of pull requests opened per day increased from 3.5 to 7 which means we have handled about <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?page=24&amp;q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">600 pull requests</a> in the last three months.</p><p>We merged <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01+label%3A%22Merged%22+" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost two-thirds</a> and closed one-third of the pull requests. They were closed without being merged if they are obsolete or low quality, or if they unnecessarily increase the project&#x27;s surface area. Most of the merged pull requests fixed bugs, improved cross-platform parity, or introduced new features. Notable contributions include improving type safety and the ongoing work to support AndroidX.</p><p>At Facebook, we run React Native from master, so we test all changes first before they make it into a React Native Release. Out of all the merged pull requests, only six caused issues: four only affected internal development and two were caught in the release candidate state.</p><p>One of the more visible community contributions was <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/22242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the updated “RedBox” screen</a>. It&#x27;s a good example of how the community is making the developer experience friendlier.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="lean-core"></a>Lean Core<a class="hash-link" href="#lean-core" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>React Native currently has a very wide surface area with many unmaintained abstractions that we do not use a lot at Facebook. We are working on reducing the surface area in order to make React Native smaller and allow the community to take better care of abstractions that are mostly unused at Facebook.</p><p>In the first milestone, <a href="https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1093171521114247171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we asked the community for help on the Lean Core project</a>. The response was overwhelming and we could barely keep up with all the progress. <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out all the work completed in less than a month</a>!</p><p>What we are most excited about is that maintainers have jumped in fixing long standing issues, adding tests, and supporting long requested features. These modules are getting more support than they ever did within React Native, showing that this is a great step for the community. Examples of such projects are <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView</a> that has <a href="https://twitter.com/titozzz/status/1101283928026034176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received many pull requests</a> since their extraction and the CLI that is now <a href="https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintained by members of the community</a> and received much needed improvements and fixes.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="leading-user-problems"></a>Leading User Problems<a class="hash-link" href="#leading-user-problems" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In December, we asked the community what they <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disliked about React Native</a>. We aggregated the responses and <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied to each and every problem</a>. Fortunately, many of the issues that our community faces are also problems at Facebook. In our next milestone, we plan to address some of the main problems.</p><p>One of the highest voted problems was the developer experience of upgrading to newer versions of React Native. Unfortunately, this is not something that we experience ourselves because we run React Native from master. Thankfully, members from the community already stepped up to address this problem:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/thymikee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Pierzchała</a> from Callstack <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli/pull/176/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved react-native upgrade</a> by using <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rn-diff-purge</a> under the hood. We also updated the website to remove outdated upgrade instructions.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We plan on recommending CocoaPods by default for iOS projects</a> which will reduce churn in project files when upgrading React Native. This will make it easier for people to install and link third-party modules which is even more important in the context of Lean Core as we expect projects to link more modules by default.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="059-release"></a>0.59 Release<a class="hash-link" href="#059-release" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Without the help of the React Native community, especially <a href="https://github.com/grabbou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Grabowski</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kelset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorenzo Sciandra</a>, we would not be able to ship releases. We want to improve the release management process and plan to be more involved from now on:</p><ul><li>We will work with community members to create a blog post for each major release.</li><li>We will show breaking changes directly in the CLI when people upgrade to new versions.</li><li>We will reduce the time it takes to make a release. We are exploring ways to increase automated testing and also creating an improved manual test plan.</li></ul><p>Many of these plans will be incorporated in the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.59.0-rc.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native 0.59 release</a>. 0.59 will ship with React Hooks, a new 64-bit version of JavaScriptCore for Android, and many performance and functionality improvements. It is currently published as a release candidate and is expected to be stable within the next two weeks.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="next-steps"></a>Next Steps<a class="hash-link" href="#next-steps" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>For the next two months, we will continue managing pull requests <a href="https://k03lwm00zo.codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to stay on track</a> while also starting to reduce the number of outstanding GitHub issues. We will continue reducing the surface area of React Native through the Lean Core project. We plan to address 5 of the top community problems. As we finalize the community guidelines, we will turn attention to our website and documentation.</p><p>We are very excited to host over ten contributors from our community at Facebook London in March to help drive several of these efforts. We are glad that you are using React Native and hope that you&#x27;ll see and feel the improvements we are working on in 2019. We&#x27;ll be back with another update in a few months and <em>will be merging your pull requests in the meantime!</em> ⚛️✌️</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_2I12"><a href="/blog/2019/01/07/state-of-react-native-community">The State of the React Native Community in 2018</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-01-07T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_2q4-">January 7, 2019  · 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/kelset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16104054?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Lorenzo Sciandra"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/kelset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorenzo Sciandra</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Core Maintainer &amp; React Native Developer</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>In 2018 the React Native Community made a number of changes to the way we develop and communicate about React Native. We believe that a few years from now we will look back and see that this shift was a turning point for React Native.</p><p>A lot of people are excited about the rewrite of React Native&#x27;s architecture, widely known as <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabric</a>. Among other things, this will fix fundamental limitations in React Native&#x27;s architecture and will set up React Native for success in the future together with <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSI and TurboModules</a>.</p><p>The biggest shift in 2018 was to empower the React Native Community. From the beginning, Facebook encouraged developers from all around the world to participate in React Native&#x27;s open source project. Since then, a number of core contributors emerged to handle, among other things, the release process.</p><p>These members took a few substantial steps towards making the whole community more empowered to shape the future of this project with the following resources:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="react-native-releases-"></a><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>react-native-releases</code></a> 📬<a class="hash-link" href="#react-native-releases-" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This repository, created in January, serves the dual purpose of allowing everyone to keep up the new releases in a more collaborative manner and opened the conversation of what would be part of a certain release to whomever wanted to suggest a cherry-pick (like for <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.57.8</a> and all its previous versions).</p><p>This has been the driving force behind moving away from a monthly release cycle, and the &quot;long term support&quot; approach currently used for version 0.57.x.</p><p>Half of the credit for reaching these decisions goes to the other repository created this year:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="discussions-and-proposals-"></a><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>discussions-and-proposals</code></a> 🗣<a class="hash-link" href="#discussions-and-proposals-" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This repository, created in July, expanded on the idea of a more open environment for conversations on React Native. Previously, this need was handled by issues labelled <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/labels/For%20Discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>For Discussion</code></a> in the main repository, but we wanted to expand this strategy to an RFC approach that other libraries have (e.g. React).</p><p>This experiment immediately found its role in the React Native lifecycle. The Facebook team is now using the community RFC process to discuss what could <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be improved in React Native</a>, and coordinate the efforts around the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Core project</a> - among other interesting discussions.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="reactnativecomm-"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ReactNativeComm</a> 🐣<a class="hash-link" href="#reactnativecomm-" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We are aware that our approach to communicate these efforts has not been as effective as we would have liked, and in an attempt to give you all an easier time keeping up with everything going on in the React Native Community (from releases to active discussions) we created a new twitter account that you can rely on <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ReactNativeComm</a>.</p><p>If you are not on that social network, remember that you can always watch repositories via GitHub; this feature improved these past few months with the possibility of being notified only for releases, so you should consider using it anyway.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="what-awaits-ahead-"></a>What awaits ahead 🎓<a class="hash-link" href="#what-awaits-ahead-" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Over the past 7-8 months, core contributors enhanced the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native Community GitHub organization</a> to take more ownership over the development of React Native, and enhance collaboration with Facebook. But this always lacked the formal structure that similar projects may have in place.</p><p>This organization can set the example for everyone in the larger developer community by enforcing a set of standards for all the packages/repos hosted in it, providing a single place for maintainers to help each other and contribute quality code that conforms to community-agreed standards.</p><p>In early 2019, we will have this new set of guidelines in place. Let us know what you think in the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated discussion</a>.</p><p>We are confident that with these changes, the community will become more collaborative so that when we reach 1.0, we will all continue to write (even more) awesome apps by leveraging this joint effort 🤗</p><hr><p>I hope you are as excited as we are about the future of this community.

Before I do so, I&#x27;d like to lay out our long-term vision for React Native in open source.</p><p>Our vision for React Native is...</p><ul><li><strong>A healthy GitHub repository.</strong> Issues and pull requests get handled within a reasonable period of time.<ul><li>Increased test coverage.</li><li>Commits that sync out from the Facebook code repository should not break open source tests.</li><li>A higher scale of meaningful community contributions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stable APIs,</strong> making it easier to interface with open source dependencies.<ul><li>Facebook uses the same public API as open source</li><li>React Native releases that follow semantic versioning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>A vibrant eco-system.</strong> High quality ViewManagers, native modules, and multiple platform support maintained by the community.</li><li><strong>Excellent documentation.</strong> Focus on helping users create high quality experiences, and up-to-date API reference docs.</li></ul><p>We have identified the following focus areas to help us achieve this vision.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="️-lean-core"></a>✂️ Lean Core<a class="hash-link" href="#️-lean-core" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Our goal is to <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce the surface area of React Native</a> by removing non-core and unused components.

Tools that may be popular in the open source community are not used at Facebook. There may be an internal tool that achieves the same purpose. In some cases, Facebook teams have become used to tools that do not exist outside of Facebook. These disparities can pose challenges when we open source our upcoming architecture work.</p><p>We&#x27;ll work on releasing some of these internal tools.

These tests identify whether a change might break one of our own React Native surfaces. Yet, there are differences in how Facebook uses React Native. This has allowed us to unknowingly break React Native in open source.</p><p>We&#x27;ll shore up our internal tests to ensure they run in an environment that is as close as possible to open source. This will help prevent code that breaks these tests from making it to open source. We will also work on infrastructure to enable better testing of the core repo on GitHub, enabling future pull requests to easily include tests.</p><p>Combined with the reduced surface area, this will allow contributors to merge pull requests quicker, with confidence.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="-public-api"></a>📜 Public API<a class="hash-link" href="#-public-api" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Facebook will consume React Native via the public API, the same way open source does, to reduce unintentional breaking changes.

In iOS 12, which will be released in the upcoming months, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/234/?time=104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UIWebViews will be formally deprecated</a>. React Native&#x27;s iOS WebView implementation relies heavily on the UIWebView class. Therefore, in light of these developments, we&#x27;ve built a new native iOS backend to the WebView React Native component that uses WKWebView.</p><p>The tail end of these changes were landed in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/33b353c97c31190439a22febbd3d2a9ead49d3c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this commit</a>, and will become available in the 0.57 release.</p><p>To opt into this new implementation, please use the <a href="/docs/0.63/webview#usewebkit"><code>useWebKit</code></a> prop:</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_1daz"><div class="codeBlockContent_2es_"><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-js codeBlock_27aQ thin-scrollbar"><div class="codeBlockLines_2rCb" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><div class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">&lt;</span><span class="token maybe-class-name">WebView</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token plain">  useWebKit</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">=</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">{</span><span class="token boolean" style="color:#ff8b50">true</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">}</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token plain">  source</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">=</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">{</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">{</span><span class="token plain"> url</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#8dc891">&#x27;https://www.google.com&#x27;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#657b83">}</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#FFFFFF;background:#282C34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">/</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#fc929e">&gt;</span></div></div></div><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_2bml">Copy</button></div></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="improvements"></a>Improvements<a class="hash-link" href="#improvements" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><code>UIWebView</code> had no legitimate way to facilitate communication between the JavaScript running in the WebView, and React Native. When messages were sent from the WebView, we relied on a hack to deliver them to React Native. Succinctly, we encoded the message data into a url with a special scheme, and navigated the WebView to it. On the native side, we intercepted and cancelled this navigation, parsed the data from the url, and finally called into React Native. This implementation was error prone and insecure. I&#x27;m glad to announce that we&#x27;ve leveraged <code>WKWebView</code> features to completely replace it.</p><p>Other benefits of WKWebView over UIWebView include faster JavaScript execution, and a multi-process architecture.

The two biggest problems with these properties are that:</p><ol><li><strong>They are two different properties with different usage methods, yet have the same purpose.</strong> In the previous API, these are two separate properties (one for each platform), which was not only inconvenient, but also confusing to many developers. <code>accessibilityTraits</code> on iOS allows 17 different values while <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> on Android allows only 4 values. Furthermore, the values for the most part had no overlap. Even the input types for these two properties are different. <code>accessibilityTraits</code> allows either an array of traits to be passed in or a single trait, while <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> allows only a single value.</li><li><strong>There is very limited functionality on Android.</strong> With the old property, the only UI elements that Talkback were able to recognize were “button,” “radiobutton_checked,” and “radiobutton_unchecked.”</li></ol><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="problem-two-non-existent-accessibility-hints"></a>Problem Two: Non-existent Accessibility Hints:<a class="hash-link" href="#problem-two-non-existent-accessibility-hints" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Accessibility Hints help users using TalkBack or VoiceOver understand what will happen when they perform an action on an accessibility element that is not apparent by only the accessibility label. These hints can be turned on and off in the settings panel. Previously, React Native&#x27;s API did not support accessibility hints at all.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="problem-three-ignoring-inverted-colors"></a>Problem Three: Ignoring Inverted Colors:<a class="hash-link" href="#problem-three-ignoring-inverted-colors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Some users with vision loss use inverted colors on their mobile phones to have greater screen contrast. Apple provided an API for iOS which allows developers to ignore certain views. This way, images and videos aren&#x27;t distorted when a user has the inverted colors setting on. This API is currently unsupported by React Native.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="design-of-the-new-api"></a>Design of the New API<a class="hash-link" href="#design-of-the-new-api" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="solution-one-combining-accessibilitycomponenttype-android-and-accessibilitytraits-ios"></a>Solution One: Combining accessibilityComponentType (Android) and accessibilityTraits (iOS)<a class="hash-link" href="#solution-one-combining-accessibilitycomponenttype-android-and-accessibilitytraits-ios" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In order to solve the confusion between <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> and <code>accessibilityTraits</code>, we decided to merge them into a single property. This made sense because they technically had the same intended functionality and by merging them, developers no longer had to worry about platform specific intricacies when building accessibility features.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>On iOS, <code>UIAccessibilityTraits</code> is a property that can be set on any NSObject. Each of the 17 traits passed in through the javascript property to native is mapped to a <code>UIAccessibilityTraits</code> element in Objective-C. Traits are each represented by a long int, and every trait that is set is ORed together.</p><p>On Android however, <code>AccessibilityComponentType</code> is a concept that was made up by React Native, and doesn&#x27;t directly map to any properties in Android. Accessibility is handled by an accessibility delegate. Each view has a default accessibility delegate. If you want to customize any accessibility actions, you have to create a new accessibility delegate, override specific methods you want to customize, and then set the accessibility delegate of the view you are handling to be associated with the new delegate. When a developer set <code>AccessibilityComponentType</code>, the native code created a new delegate based off of the component that was passed in, and set the view to have that accessibility delegate.</p><p><strong>Changes Made</strong></p><p>For our new property, we wanted to create a superset of the two properties. We decided to keep the new property modeled mostly after the existing property <code>accessibilityTraits</code>, since <code>accessibilityTraits</code> has significantly more values. The functionality of Android for these traits would be polyfilled in by modifying the Accessibility Delegate.</p><p>There are 17 values of UIAccessibilityTraits that <code>accessibilityTraits</code> on iOS can be set to. However, we didn&#x27;t include all of them as possible values to our new property. This is because the effect of setting some of these traits is actually not very well known, and many of these values are virtually never used.</p><p>The values UIAccessibilityTraits were set to generally took on one of two purposes. They either described a role that UI element had, or they described the state a UI element was in. Most uses of the previous properties we observed usually used one value that represented a role and combined it with either “state selected,” “state disabled,” or both. Therefore, we decided to create two new accessibility properties: <code>accessibilityRole</code> and <code>accessibilityState</code>.</p><p><strong><code>accessibilityRole</code></strong></p><p>The new property, <code>accessibilityRole</code>, is used to tell Talkback or Voiceover the role of a UI Element. This new property can take on one of the following values:</p><ul><li><code>none</code></li><li><code>button</code></li><li><code>link</code></li><li><code>search</code></li><li><code>image</code></li><li><code>keyboardkey</code></li><li><code>text</code></li><li><code>adjustable</code></li><li><code>header</code></li><li><code>summary</code></li><li><code>imagebutton</code></li></ul><p>This property only allows one value to be passed in because UI elements generally don&#x27;t logically take on more than one of these. The exception is image and button, so we&#x27;ve added a role imagebutton that is a combination of both.</p><p><strong><code>accessibilityStates</code></strong></p><p>The new property, <code>accessibilityStates</code>, is used to tell Talkback or Voiceover the state a UI Element is in. This property takes on an Array containing one or both of the following values:</p><ul><li><code>selected</code></li><li><code>disabled</code></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="solution-two-adding-accessibility-hints"></a>Solution Two: Adding Accessibility Hints<a class="hash-link" href="#solution-two-adding-accessibility-hints" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>For this, we added a new property, <code>accessibilityHint</code>. Setting this property will allow Talkback or Voiceover to recite the hint to users.</p><p><strong><code>accessibilityHint</code></strong></p><p>This property takes in the accessibility hint to be read in the form of a String.</p><p>On iOS, setting this property will set the corresponding native property AccessibilityHint on the view. The hint will then be read by Voiceover if Accessibility Hints are turned on in the iPhone.</p><p>On Android, setting this property appends the value of the hint to the end of the accessibility label. The upside to this implementation is that it mimics the behavior of hints on iOS, but the downside to this implementation is that these hints cannot be turned off in the settings on Android the way they can be on iOS.</p><p>The reason we made this decision on Android is because normally, accessibility hints correspond with a specific action (e.g. click), and we wanted to keep behaviors consistent across platforms.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="solution-to-problem-three"></a>Solution to Problem Three<a class="hash-link" href="#solution-to-problem-three" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong><code>accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors</code></strong></p><p>We exposed Apple&#x27;s api AccessibilityIgnoresInvertColors to JavaScript, so now when you have a view where you don&#x27;t want colors to be inverted (e.g image), you can set this property to true, and it won&#x27;t be inverted.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="new-usage"></a>New Usage<a class="hash-link" href="#new-usage" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>These new properties will become available in the React Native 0.57 release.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="how-to-upgrade"></a>How to Upgrade<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-upgrade" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you are currently using <code>accessibilityComponentType</code> and <code>accessibilityTraits</code>, here are the steps you can take to upgrade to the new properties.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="1-using-jscodeshift"></a>1.

We also want to take the opportunity to explain what has kept us busy since March.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="the-breaking-changes-dilemma-or-when-to-release"></a>The breaking changes dilemma, or, &quot;when to release?&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#the-breaking-changes-dilemma-or-when-to-release" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor&#x27;s Guide</a> explains the integration process that all changes to React Native go through. The project has is composed by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many different tools</a>, requiring coordination and constant support to keep everything working properly. Add to this the vibrant open source community that contributes back to the project, and you will get a sense of the mind-bending scale of it all.</p><p>With React Native&#x27;s impressive adoption, breaking changes must be made with great care, and the process is not as smooth as we&#x27;d like. A decision was made to skip the April and May releases to allow the core team to integrate and test a new set of breaking changes. <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated community communication</a> channels were used along the way to ensure that the June 2018 (<code>0.56.0</code>) release is as hassle-free as possible to adopt by those who patiently waited for the stable release.</p><p>Is <code>0.56.0</code> perfect? No, as every piece of software out there: but we reached a point where the tradeoff between &quot;waiting for more stability&quot; versus &quot;testing led to successful results so we can push forward&quot; that we feel ready to release it. Moreover, we are aware <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues</a> that are not solved in the final <code>0.56.0</code> release. Most developers should have no issues upgrading to <code>0.56.0</code>. For those that are blocked by the aforementioned issues, we hope to see you around in our discussions and we are looking forward to working with you on a solution to these issues.</p><p>You might consider <code>0.56.0</code> as a fundamental building block towards a more stable framework: it will take probably a week or two of widespread adoption before all the edge cases will be sanded off, but this will lead to an even better July 2018 (<code>0.57.0</code>) release.</p><p>We&#x27;d like to conclude this section by thanking <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/v0.55.4...v0.56.0-rc.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all the 67 contributors who worked on a total of 818 commits</a> (!) that will help make your apps even better 👏.</p><p>And now, without further ado...</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="the-big-changes"></a>The Big Changes<a class="hash-link" href="#the-big-changes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="babel-7"></a>Babel 7<a class="hash-link" href="#babel-7" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As you may know, the transpiler tool that allows us all to use the latest and greatest features of JavaScript, Babel, is moving to <a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v7 soon</a>. Since this new version brings along some important changes, we felt that now it would be a good time to upgrade, allowing <a href="https://github.com/facebook/metro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a> to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/92" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leverage on its improvements</a>.</p><p>If you find yourself in trouble with upgrading, please refer to the <a href="https://new.babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation section related to it</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="modernizing-android-support"></a>Modernizing Android support<a class="hash-link" href="#modernizing-android-support" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>On Android, much of the surrounding tooling has changed.

One of our most popular products is Marketplace, one of the top-level tabs in our app which is used by 800 million people each month. Since its creation in 2015, all of Marketplace has been built with React Native, including over a hundred full-screen views throughout different parts of the app.</p><p>We&#x27;re also using React Native for many new parts of the app. If you watched the F8 keynote last month, you&#x27;ll recognize Blood Donations, Crisis Response, Privacy Shortcuts, and Wellness Checks – all recent features built with React Native. And projects outside the main Facebook app are using React Native too. The new Oculus Go VR headset includes <a href="https://www.oculus.com/app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a companion mobile app</a> that is fully built with React Native, not to mention React VR powering many experiences in the headset itself.</p><p>Naturally, we also use many other technologies to build our apps. <a href="https://fblitho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Litho</a> and <a href="https://componentkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ComponentKit</a> are two libraries we use extensively in our apps; both provide a React-like component API for building native screens. It&#x27;s never been a goal for React Native to replace all other technologies – we are focused on making React Native itself better, but we love seeing other teams borrow ideas from React Native, like bringing <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/instant-feedback-in-ios-engineering-workflows-c3f6508c76c8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instant reload</a> to non-JavaScript code too.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="architecture"></a>Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#architecture" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When we started the React Native project in 2013, we designed it to have a single “bridge” between JavaScript and native that is asynchronous, serializable, and batched. Just as React DOM turns React state updates into imperative, mutative calls to DOM APIs like <code>document.createElement(attrs)</code> and <code>.appendChild()</code>, React Native was designed to return a single JSON message that lists mutations to perform, like <code>[[&quot;createView&quot;, attrs], [&quot;manageChildren&quot;, ...]]</code>. We designed the entire system to never rely on getting a synchronous response back and to ensure everything in that list could be fully serialized to JSON and back. We did this for the flexibility it gave us: on top of this architecture, we were able to build tools like <a href="/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools">Chrome debugging</a>, which runs all the JavaScript code asynchronously over a WebSocket connection.</p><p>Over the last 5 years, we found that these initial principles have made building some features harder. An asynchronous bridge means you can&#x27;t integrate JavaScript logic directly with many native APIs expecting synchronous answers. A batched bridge that queues native calls means it&#x27;s harder to have React Native apps call into functions that are implemented natively. And a serializable bridge means unnecessary copying instead of directly sharing memory between the two worlds. For apps that are entirely built in React Native, these restrictions are usually bearable. But for apps with complex integration between React Native and existing app code, they are frustrating.</p><p><strong>We&#x27;re working on a large-scale rearchitecture of React Native to make the framework more flexible and integrate better with native infrastructure in hybrid JavaScript/native apps.</strong> With this project, we&#x27;ll apply what we&#x27;ve learned over the last 5 years and incrementally bring our architecture to a more modern one. We&#x27;re rewriting many of React Native&#x27;s internals, but most of the changes are under the hood: existing React Native apps will continue to work with few or no changes.</p><p>To make React Native more lightweight and fit better into existing native apps, this rearchitecture has three major internal changes. First, we are changing the threading model. Instead of each UI update needing to perform work on three different threads, it will be possible to call synchronously into JavaScript on any thread for high-priority updates while still keeping low-priority work off the main thread to maintain responsiveness. Second, we are incorporating <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">async rendering</a> capabilities into React Native to allow multiple rendering priorities and to simplify asynchronous data handling. Finally, we are simplifying our bridge to make it faster and more lightweight; direct calls between native and JavaScript are more efficient and will make it easier to build debugging tools like cross-language stack traces.</p><p>Once these changes are completed, closer integrations will be possible. Today, it&#x27;s not possible to incorporate native navigation and gesture handling or native components like UICollectionView and RecyclerView without complex hacks. After our changes to the threading model, building features like this will be straightforward.</p><p>We&#x27;ll release more details about this work later this year as it approaches completion.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_E4oP" id="community"></a>Community<a class="hash-link" href="#community" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Alongside the community inside Facebook, we&#x27;re happy to have a thriving population of React Native users and collaborators outside Facebook. We&#x27;d like to support the React Native community more, both by serving React Native users better and by making the project easier to contribute to.</p><p>Just as our architecture changes will help React Native interoperate more cleanly with other native infrastructure, React Native should be slimmer on the JavaScript side to fit better with the JavaScript ecosystem, which includes making the VM and bundler swappable. We know the pace of breaking changes can be hard to keep up with, so we&#x27;d like to find ways to have fewer major releases. Finally, we know that some teams are looking for more thorough documentation in topics like startup optimization, where our expertise hasn&#x27;t yet been written down. Expect to see some of these changes over the coming year.</p><p>If you&#x27;re using React Native, you&#x27;re part of our community; keep letting us know how we can make React Native better for you.</p><p>React Native is just one tool in a mobile developer&#x27;s toolbox, but it&#x27;s one that we strongly believe in – and we&#x27;re making it better every day, with over 2500 commits in the last year from 500+ contributors.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/engineering">engineering</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">« Newer Entries</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries »</div></a></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Docs</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/tutorial">Tutorial</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/components-and-apis">Components and APIs</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/more-resources">More Resources</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/help">The React Native Community</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/showcase">Who&#x27;s using React Native?</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Ask Questions on Stack Overflow</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Contributor Guide</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://dev.to/t/reactnative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">DEV Community</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Find us</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/reactnative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">React</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://opensource.facebook.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://opensource.facebook.com/legal/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Terms of Service</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://opensource.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footerLogoLink_3cAK"><img class="footer__logo" alt="Facebook Open Source Logo" src="/img/oss_logo.png"></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2021 Facebook, Inc.</div></div></div></footer></div>
